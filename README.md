# Libbluray
**Libbluray** is an open-source **lib**rary designed for **Blu-Ray** Discs playback for media players, like **VLC** or **MPlayer**.

## Open3DOLED fork notes

This fork contains the Open3DOLED MVC integration maintained for 3D Blu-ray
playback experiments and runtime validation.

The Open3DOLED changes on branch `open3doled_001` are intentionally small in
surface area and are focused on:

- exposing MVC-related clip and subpath metadata needed during navigation
- adding paired base/dependent stream handling in the main libbluray playback
  path
- emitting the merged MVC-oriented access pattern expected by the Open3DOLED
  VLC integration
- keeping the fork buildable with the upstream Meson build

Project-specific investigation notes and machine-local analysis logs are kept
outside this fork and are not part of the tracked upstream-facing source tree.



## Goals and features

This research project is developed by an **international team** of developers from **Doom9** and **VideoLAN**.

The library integrates navigation, playlist parsing, menus and BD-J menus.

Most commercial Blu-Ray are protected by **AACS** or **BD+** technologies and this library is not enough to playback those discs.

People interested in AACS technologies should have a look at [libaacs](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libaacs).

People interested in BD+ technologies should have a look at [libbdplus](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libbdplus).

## Disclaimer

This library is written for the purpose of playing Blu-ray movies. It is
intended for software that want to support Blu-ray playback (such as VLC and
MPlayer). We, the authors of this library, do not condone nor endorse piracy.

This library is simply a tool for playback of Blu-ray movies. Like any tool, the
use of this tool can also be abused. There are already numerous laws in
different countries and juridictions all over the world that protect copyrighted
material, such as Blu-ray movies. With that said, it would have been
inappropriate for us to distribute this library with terms such as "you cannot
use this library for piracy". Instead, we present to everyone this disclaimer.

As a reminder, here is also the disclaimer found at the beginning of any movie
in relation to copyrights.

## ATTENTION

International agreement and national laws protect copyrighted motion pictures,
videotapes, and sound recordings.

UNAUTHORIZED REPRODUCTION, EXHIBITION OR DISTRIBUTION OF COPYRIGHTED MOTION
PICTURES CAN RESULT IN SEVERE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES UNDER THE LAWS OF

The International Criminal Police Organization - INTERPOL, has expressed its
concern about motion picture and sound recording piracy to all of its member
national police forces. (Resolution adopted at INTERPOL General Assembly,
Stockholm, Sweden, September 8, 1977.)
